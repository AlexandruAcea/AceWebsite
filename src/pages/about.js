          <h1 style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>Hobbies</h1>

            I'd like to say that everything I do is more or less a hobby but
            some of my favorites are taking photos and videos and sharing them
            on my Instagram where I have over 45k followers.
          </h2>

          <h1 style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>Experience</h1>
          <h2>
            Started programming at 16 developing my first Android apps
            <br />
            Developed around 30 apps for fun and experimenting, but I'm only
            proud of 3 of them. BreakList, which was featured by LifeHacker.
            AceWalls which I've made to share my photos and got over 30k
            downloads. And TextValet which is the most ambitious app I've done.
            <br />
            <br />
            At that point I was learning Web Development on and off but didn't
            really like it until I was around 19 and started making web apps.
            I've got a local restaurant to be my first client and I made a full
            online order system for them. Meanwhile I've made more projects for
            fun and to learn better.
            <br />
            <br />
            Then I started learning React and I've done more freelancer (such as
            an ecommerce store) and personal work, like this website! Which is
            fully made with ReactJS.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've recently worked on a team project with Nokia and I had to
            create a full fledged online voting system, where I've built the
            backend and API with NodeJS and Express and deployed it to a Linux
            server. Then I also created an online platform with React and a
            mobile app with ReactNative. It was a really extensive project and
            I've learned a lot from it.
            <br />
            Especially the backend side.
          </h2>

          <h1 style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>The why</h1>
          <h2>
            I've always been passionate about creating and finding new ways to
            express my inner creativity, and so far coding has helped me achieve
            that the most. It lets me merge all of my hobbies and passions such
            as photography, video editing and design. I view it as logic based
            creativity.
            <br />
            Also I love exploring new technologies and tinker with them to see
            how they work and how they could help me create
          </h2>

          <h1 style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>Education</h1>
          <h2>
            I'm one of those people that says that school isn't important while
            also pursuing a CS degree at The West University of Timisoara.
            <br />
            But for me school isn't importand, education on the other hand is.
            I've always learned on my own in order to understand more complex
            subjects and gain new skills. I've completed numerous courses and
            tutorials, while making a lot of personal projects on the side.
